# Paste Eater
A very simple pastebin service. Nothing fancy. Works with ShareX.

## Installing
Ensure you have Go installed and setup properly, as well as [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) then run the following commands

`godep get` 
That will fetch and install the dependencies.

Once all the dependencies are installed simply run `go install`
